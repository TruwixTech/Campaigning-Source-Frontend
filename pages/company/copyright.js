                            Copyright is a legal right that authors, musicians, and artists have towards others using their creative
                            works. Film and music producers also benefit from this right. They can get online copyright
                            registration for musical compositions, copyright song lyrics, copyright videos, and much more

                        </h2>
                        <p className='text-gray-400'>
                            Copyright, a form of intellectual property law, protects original works of authorship including literary,
                            dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software, and
                            architecture. Copyright does not protect facts, ideas, systems, or methods of operation, although it
                            may protect the way these things are expressed.
                            Nine Categories of Works are Copyrightable<br />
                            ● <strong>Books:</strong> Copyright registration in India provides legal protection to the author's literary works.
                            Since everything is altered, transferred, and copied so quickly in our era, the copyright
                            registration process for literary work is crucial. It is used for book publishing and
                            newsletters.<br />
                            ● <strong>Software:</strong> The IT sector in India is quickly expanding, and it is necessary to protect your
                            unique work or software. Many programmers, coders, and developers get cheated when they
                            come across software that is close to or identical to what they created. The copyright
                            registration in India for software prevents any individual or third-party company from gaining
                            unofficial access to the software.<br />
                            ● <strong>Scripts:</strong> A script is a written outline for a play, television programme, or film. Copyright
                            application for a creative work—such as a script—prevents individuals from engaging in
                            unauthorized use of your script, such as intentional and accidental copying, publishing,
                            transmitting, exhibiting, distributing, modifying, and displaying other people's original creative
                            expressions.<br />
                            ● <strong>Lyrics:</strong> When you copyright registration, you have full protection for your song. Copyright
                            application protects your lyrics as soon as you write them, even if it's only on a bit of paper.
                            The online copyright registration of lyrics gives the song constructive notice. The melody,
                            lyrics, percussion track on the recording and chord progression in the bridge are all distinct
                            and expressive elements to which the author might claim any of the exclusive rights.<br />
                            ● <strong>Websites:</strong> Text, tables, computer programmes, compilations, including computer databases;
                            photographs, paintings, diagrams, maps, charts, and plans; and works incorporating music,
                            including graphical notation of such work that may be copyrightable are among the digital
                            assets on the website. You only have copyright rights to the elements of a website that you
                            created as an author.<br />
                            ● <strong>Apps:</strong> Copyrights can be used to safeguard intellectual property such as computer
                            programs. Early designs of creativity can take on many forms, including software code,
                            graphics, and models used to create mobile applications and other computer software.
                            Copyright registration of software allows a developer to more easily defend his work if it is
                            attempted to be copied. For software copyrights, the code, as well as copies of artwork and
                            audiovisual content, must be included with the application for copyright registration.<br />
                            ● <strong>Videos:</strong> Copyright registration for video serves as clear evidence in any copyright
                            infringement lawsuit you may file copyright online, and it makes collecting damages much
                            easier in such a situation. It's a simple way to establish your video rights. If you actually want
                            to protect your work, copyrighting your videos should be at the top of your priority list.<br />
                            ● <strong>Songs:</strong> It is important to obtain a copyright application for your song, as it is now easier than
                            ever for others to use your work without giving you the credit you deserve. If you're a new
                            musician, it's even more crucial to think about copyright protection because you might not
                            have the resources to fight if your song is misused/pirated.<br />
                            ● <strong>Music:</strong> Whether you're attempting to safeguard a song or a symphony, the first step is to get
                            the music down in some tangible format, such as recording or writing on music staff paper. It
                            can be difficult to assert your rights in a copyright infringement claim if you do not have
                            recognised copyright in India for your music. And as a musician with registered copyright for
                            your work, you have a lot of exclusive rights.<br />

                            phone number, e-mail address, and nationality are necessary for copyright registration in
                            India.

                            The applicant must obtain a clear copyright lookup certificate from the trademark
                            registration office if the copyright is connected to any creative work. If the original

                            The duration of copyright protection varies based on factors like publication and
                            creation date. For works produced after January 1, 1978, copyright typically lasts for the
                            author's lifetime plus an additional 70 years. In India, copyright is valid for anonymous,
                            pseudonymous, or work created for hire for 95 years from initial publication or 120
                            years from creation, whichever comes first. Registration renewal for works published or
                            registered before January 1, 1978, is optional after 28 years, but it offers legal benefits.

                            An original work is a product of an individual's intellectual effort that is not copied from
                            existing work. Original works eligible for copyright registration include literary works,
                            musical compositions, artistic creations, software code, etc. The work must be original
                            and fixed in a physical medium for copyright application.
