                            The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a type of tax on the consumption of goods and
                            services in countries, collected by businesses from consumers and paid to the
                            government. It was introduced officially in India on 1 July 2017, replacing the earlier
                            system of multiple taxes, such as excise duty, service tax, and value-added tax (VAT).
                            The 101st Constitutional Amendment / One Hundred and First Amendment Act, 2016 of
                            the Constitution of India is a significant piece of legislation that has had a prominent
                            impact on the Indian economy. It was passed in 2016 to introduce the Goods and
                            Services Tax (GST), a value-added tax (VAT) that has simplified the tax system and
                            boosted economic growth. This constitutional amendment was introduced as a
                            nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) concept in India.
                            GST registration is mandatory for all businesses with an annual turnover of more than
                            ₹40 lakhs (₹ 20 lakhs for businesses in special category states).

                            GSTIN stands for Goods and Services Tax Identification Number. It is a unique 15-digit
                            number assigned to every taxpayer registered under the GST regime in India. The GSTIN
                            is used to identify taxpayers and to track their transactions.
                            The GSTIN is structured as follows:
                            ● The first two digits represent the state code.<br />
                            ● The next ten digits are the PAN card number of the taxpayer.<br />
                            ● The thirteenth digit is an entity code used to distinguish between different types
                            of taxpayers.<br />
                            ● The fourteenth digit is a fixed alphabet 'Z'.<br />
                            ● The fifteenth digit is a check digit, which is used to verify the accuracy of the
                            GSTIN<br />
